### New features added
* sphinx sidebars functionality [#233](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-book-theme/pull/233) ([@choldgraf](https://github.com/choldgraf)). You can now use the `html_sidebars` functionality that is native in Sphinx.

* Collapsible lists in sidebars [#226](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-book-theme/pull/226) ([@AakashGfude](https://github.com/AakashGfude)). Sidebars that have nested sections will now have an arrow that allows you to reveal these sections without changing the current page. You can [control the depth](https://sphinx-book-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configure.html#control-the-depth-of-the-left-sidebar-lists-to-expand) of expanded sections with `show_navbar_depth`.

### Enhancements made
* Option for download button [#245](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-book-theme/pull/245) ([@bknaepen](https://github.com/bknaepen)). The "download" button used to be automatically added, but can now be removed.
