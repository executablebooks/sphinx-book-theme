# Changelog

## v0.3-pre - 2022-02-025

This is a significant change in the HTML and CSS of the site, with the goal of making it more standardized and robust. There are several design tweaks that have been made. Here is a short overview:

- The sidebars are now a slightly smaller font, with more padding, to give more attention to the page's content.
- The HTML structure of the site has been re-worked to make `sticky` and other CSS behaviors more dependable.
- The header buttons are now standardized and have an updated look and feel.
- The in-page margin CSS is now more reliable
- Improvements to scrollbar style throughout the site

See the PRs below for where most of these changes occurred.

## v0.1.10...v0.2.0

This release includes a few under-the-hood and performance improvements to the CSS and HTML of the theme. While there are no major new features, some of these changes have restructured the HTML so double-check your documentation, especially if you had custom CSS rules the sidebar.

Here are a few improvements:

- The right Table of Contents is now hidden using the [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) which will reduce the number of JavaScript calls and improve reliability of this feature. [#448](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-book-theme/pull/448) ([@choldgraf](https://github.com/choldgraf))

- The left sidebar is now toggle-able **only with CSS**, which should make it less prone to failure due to other conflicting javascript on the page. It now includes a "sidebar drawer" on mobile that gives more vertical space for the sidebar. [#454](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-book-theme/pull/454) ([@choldgraf](https://github.com/choldgraf))

- You can now add Deepnote buttons for notebook launch buttons [#385](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-book-theme/pull/385) ([@jakubzitny](https://github.com/jakubzitny))
