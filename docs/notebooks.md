# Content with notebooks

You can also create content with Jupyter Notebooks. The content for the current page is contained
in a Jupyter Notebook in the `notebooks/` folder of the repository. This means that we can include
code blocks and their outputs, and export them to Jekyll markdown.

**You can find the original notebook for this page [at this address](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book/blob/master/jupyter_book/book_template/content/features/notebooks.ipynb)**

## Markdown + notebooks

As it is markdown, you can embed images, HTML, etc into your posts!

![](images/cool.jpg)

You an also $add_{math}$ and

$$
math^{blocks}
$$

or

$$
\begin{align*}
\mbox{mean} la_{tex} \\ \\
math blocks
\end{align*}
$$

But make sure you \$Escape \$your \$dollar signs \$you want to keep!

## Code blocks and image outputs

Jupyter Book will also embed your code blocks and output in your book.
For example, here's some sample Matplotlib code:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-cell, thebe-init]

from matplotlib import rcParams, cycler
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
plt.ion()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Fixing random state for reproducibility
np.random.seed(19680801)

N = 10
data = [np.logspace(0, 1, 100) + np.random.randn(100) + ii for ii in range(N)]
data = np.array(data).T
cmap = plt.cm.coolwarm
rcParams['axes.prop_cycle'] = cycler(color=cmap(np.linspace(0, 1, N)))


from matplotlib.lines import Line2D
custom_lines = [Line2D([0], [0], color=cmap(0.), lw=4),
                Line2D([0], [0], color=cmap(.5), lw=4),
                Line2D([0], [0], color=cmap(1.), lw=4)]

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 5))
lines = ax.plot(data)
ax.legend(custom_lines, ['Cold', 'Medium', 'Hot']);
```

Note that the image above is captured and displayed by Jekyll.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove_input]

# Fixing random state for reproducibility
np.random.seed(19680801)

N = 10
data = [np.logspace(0, 1, 100) + .1*np.random.randn(100) + ii for ii in range(N)]
data = np.array(data).T
cmap = plt.cm.coolwarm
rcParams['axes.prop_cycle'] = cycler(color=cmap(np.linspace(0, 1, N)))


from matplotlib.lines import Line2D
custom_lines = [Line2D([0], [0], color=cmap(0.), lw=4),
                Line2D([0], [0], color=cmap(.5), lw=4),
                Line2D([0], [0], color=cmap(1.), lw=4)]

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 5))
lines = ax.plot(data)
ax.legend(custom_lines, ['Cold', 'Medium', 'Hot'])
ax.set(title="Smoother lines");
```

```{margin} You can also pop out content to the margin
For more information on how to do this,
check out {doc}`layout`.
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [margin]
print("this works for code cells too, if you add a `margin` tag to them")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# You can also include enriched outputs like Math
from IPython.display import Math
Math("\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}")
```

## Removing content before publishing

You can also remove some content before publishing your book to the web. For example,
in [the original notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book/blob/master/jupyter_book/book_template/content/features/notebooks.ipynb) there
used to be a cell below...

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove_cell]

thisvariable = "none of this should show up in the textbook"

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
x = np.random.randn(100)
y = np.random.randn(100)
ax.scatter(x, y, s=np.abs(x*100), c=x, cmap=plt.cm.coolwarm)
ax.text(0, .5, thisvariable, fontsize=20, transform=ax.transAxes)
ax.set_axis_off()
```

You can also **remove only the code** so that images and other output still show up.

Below we'll *only* display an image. It was generated with Python code in a cell,
which you can [see in the original notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book/blob/master/jupyter_book/book_template/content/features/notebooks.ipynb)

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide_input]

thisvariable = "this plot *will* show up in the textbook."

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
x = np.random.randn(100)
y = np.random.randn(100)
ax.scatter(x, y, s=np.abs(x*100), c=x, cmap=plt.cm.coolwarm)
ax.text(0, .5, thisvariable, fontsize=20, transform=ax.transAxes)
ax.set_axis_off()
```

And here we'll *only* display a Pandas DataFrame. Again, this was generated with Python code
from [this original notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/textbooks-with-jupyter/blob/master/notebooks/introduction/notebooks.ipynb).

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide_input]

import pandas as pd
pd.DataFrame([['hi', 'there'], ['this', 'is'], ['a', 'DataFrame']], columns=['Word A', 'Word B'])
```

+++ {"tags": ["popout"]}

Testing popouts before headers

## Interactive outputs

We can even do the same for *interactive* material. Below we'll display a map using [folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/). When the notebook
is converted to Markdown, the code for creating the interactive map is retained.

**Note that this will only work for some packages.** They need to be able to output standalone HTML/Javascript, and not
depend on an underlying Python kernel to work.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import folium
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
m = folium.Map(
    location=[45.372, -121.6972],
    zoom_start=12,
    tiles='Stamen Terrain'
)

folium.Marker(
    location=[45.3288, -121.6625],
    popup='Mt. Hood Meadows',
    icon=folium.Icon(icon='cloud')
).add_to(m)

folium.Marker(
    location=[45.3311, -121.7113],
    popup='Timberline Lodge',
    icon=folium.Icon(color='green')
).add_to(m)

folium.Marker(
    location=[45.3300, -121.6823],
    popup='Some Other Location',
    icon=folium.Icon(color='red', icon='info-sign')
).add_to(m)


m
```

## Rich outputs from notebook cells

+++

Because notebooks have rich text outputs, you can store these in
your Jupyter Book as well!

```{code-cell} ipython3
# The ! causes this to run as a shell command
!jupyter -h
```
