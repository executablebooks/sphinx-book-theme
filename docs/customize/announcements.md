# Announcement banners

You can provide text that is shown in an "announcement" banner.
The banner will disappear once the user scrolls down, but is styled with contrastive colors to be more noticeable.
This can be used to draw attention to certain messages but in a way that doesn't distract from reading as the person scrolls down.

To add an announcement message to your documentation, use the following configuration:

```python
html_theme_options = {
  ...
  "announcement": "My announcement!",
  ...
}
```

The value of `announcement` will be inserted in the top of your page.
This can take arbitrary HTML, for example:

```python
html_theme_options = {
  ...
  "announcement": "<p class='mystyle'>Some custom HTML!</p>",
  ...
}
```
