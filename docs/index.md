**An interactive book theme for Sphinx**.

This is a lightweight Sphinx theme designed to mimic the look-and-feel of an
interactive book. It has the following primary features:

[Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/)
: To style visual elements and add functionality.

[Flexible content layout](layout)
: Inspired by beautiful online books, such as [the Edward Tufte CSS guide](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/)

[Visual classes designed for Jupyter Notebooks](notebooks)
: Cell inputs, outputs, and interactive functionality are all supported.

[Launch buttons for online interactivity](launch)
: For pages that are built with computational material, connect your site to an online BinderHub for interactive content.

International
: All text integrated in the theme is translated to the specified [Sphinx language](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#confval-language).

:::{seealso}
This is the default theme in [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org).
