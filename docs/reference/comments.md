# Comments

This page demonstrates functionality of comment libraries.
The theme does not change the style of these libraries, but should hide their UI elements on print.

## Hypothes.is

You can activate hypothes.is with the following JS:

```
<script async="async" src="https://hypothes.is/embed.js"></script>
```

```{raw} html
<script async="async" src="https://hypothes.is/embed.js"></script>
```

## Utterances

You can activate utterances with the following JS:

```
<script
   type="text/javascript"
   src="https://utteranc.es/client.js"
