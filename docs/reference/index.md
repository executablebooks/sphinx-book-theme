# Sub-sections example

A sample chapter, there's no content here, just a placeholder to demo the navbar.

```{toctree}
demo
markdown_limits
subchapter1a/index
subchapter1b/index
chapterpage1
chapterpage2
chapterpage3
notebookpage1
blog
```

Here's a sample post list:

```{postlist}
:date: "%Y-%m-%d"
:format: "{date} - {title}"
:excerpts:
```
